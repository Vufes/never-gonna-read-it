# Diary and jurney through life

Tbh I am not sure what am I doing while creating this diary and repo its day 2 and I thought that it is great idea.

## Day 0

Was pretty good, just started.

## Day 1

Well I totally forgot that I have not put any work to this project today. I feel a bit forced to get it going as goal is not really realistic for everyday use, but it
will change I believe. Forcing commits seems like unhealthy habbit, however it is all for greater goal.

Am I loosing it already?

## Day 2

Today is a good day. I have motivation and ideas to create stuff. Problem is still the number of commits
